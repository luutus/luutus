Greetings! I'm luutus - a computer enthusiast and retro electronics collector.
I'm very interested in computers and electronics since i was very young.
Now I'm learning some code like Python to have a job in the future.It will be very hard but I belive:with patience and hard-working, everything will be completed.
Here's my profile and my repository, I will try to update weekly for everyone who interested in my work.
Thank you for reading and sorry for my bad English.
Have a good day!
